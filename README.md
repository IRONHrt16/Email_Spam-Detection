# Email Spam-Detection
Python-ML Project

Description:
This documentation aims to recognize, optimal machine learning algorithm in email categorization (i.e. spam or not spam) using following two machine learning algorithms:
1)	Naive Bayes classifier method (Accuracy obtained 98.64%)
2)	Support Vector Machines classifier method (Accuracy obtained 97.77%)
In this process, dataset is divided into different sets and given as input to each algorithm.
Total two experiments are performed and the result is obtained in terms of accuracy.
